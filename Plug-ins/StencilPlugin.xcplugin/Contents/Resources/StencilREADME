# Thanks for using Stencil to create a file template!


## Follow these instructions to continue creating your template

The ___FILEBASENAME___ files have been opened for you to edit.
These are your template files and they have been saved within your
project directory.

See "$SRC_ROOT/Stencil/File Templates/Custom/"

After editing these files, simply close the window and you're done.

You will then be able to use your new file template by selecting
"New File from Custom Template..." from the contextual menu in the
project navigator.


## Editing

Remove any code that is specific to the superclass or copied class.
Ensure you leave any ___FILEBASENAME___ or ___FILEBASENAMEASID___
references in the template files. These will be replaced when you
use your template to create a new file.

Things that you might want to remove are constant declarations,
properties and methods in the header, which are not needed, because
the new subclass will inherit.

You will probably want to completely clear out the implementation,
but it is all left there for you to decide. You may want to comment
out some of the methods that you expect to be overridden, and leave
the empty method definitions with a comment highlighting anything
special that should be done when overriding.

Remember to remove any unnecessary import statements from your
template files.

If you want to change the template files again later, you can
open them just like any other file and make changes. The changes
will be immediately visible to Xcode, without having to restart.

Look in "$SRC_ROOT/Stencil/File Templates/Custom/" to find your
template. Each template is in its own subdirectory with the
extension ".xctemplate", i.e. "MyCoolView.xctemplate".


## Using your new template

To use your new template, simply right click in the location of
the project navigator where you want to create a new file, or
select File->New from the main menu, as you would to create any
other file.

From the project navigator's contextual menu, select
"New File from Custom Template..."

Select the custom template you wish to use and continue as usual.


## Enjoy

This plugin (like all plugins) is intended to make your life
easier and avoid repetitive tasks.
